    <p>We build a quantitative heterogeneous agents macro-housing model with endogenously and dynamically evolving credit scores based on householdsâ€™ earnings and decision-making behavior regarding portfolio choices and debt repayment.</p>
    
    <p>Utilizing this model, we conduct counterfactual analyses to examine the consequences of implementing a minimum credit score requirement in the mortgage loan market, a practice that has become prevalent since the 2008 Great Recession.</p>
    
    <p>We obtain the result as follows: The minimum credit score threshold decreases the mortgage default risk, which reduces average mortgage rates. Also, the threshold decreases the average Loan-to-Value ratio and the fraction of mortgage owners. Intriguingly, when the threshold is set at the subprime credit score level, the rate of homeownership increases by approximately 5 percentage points.</p>
    
    <p>Our counterfactual experiments and econometric analyses reveal that the 5 percentage point increase in homeownership is equally influenced by two key factors: i) credit scores motivation, which encourages households to pursue ownership in anticipation of the positive effects of ownership on creditworthiness; and ii) the availability of affordable mortgage rates, facilitated by reduced default behavior in an economy with minimum credit score requirement.</p>

    <p>From a distributional perspective, for households in the lower-income bracket, the rate of homeownership remains largely static, as these households have a higher likelihood of credit rationing due to strong relation between income and credit score, which are endogenously derived in the model economy.</p>
